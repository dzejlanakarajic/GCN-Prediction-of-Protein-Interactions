# GCN-Prediction-of-Protein-Interactions
The final project for Data Science Lab held @ University of Passau.

## Goal
In the context of PPI, predicting if a possible link exists between two proteins can be formulated as a link prediction problem. In this project, a publicly available Yeast network is used to build a GCN model that can predict new interactions.
